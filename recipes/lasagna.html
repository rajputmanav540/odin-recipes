    <h3>Description</h3>
    <br>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
<li>½ cup minced onion</li>
<li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
<li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
<li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
<li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
<li>⅛ teaspoon white sugar</li>
<li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
<li>1 pound small-curd cottage cheese</li>
<li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
<li>3 large eggs</li>
<li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>

</ul>
<br>
<strong><h3>Steps</h3></strong>
<ul>
  <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
  <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
  <li>Cook and stir until browned and crumbly, about 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar.</li>
  <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.</li>
  <li>Cook lasagna noodles, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Drain noodles and set aside.</li>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
  <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
  <li>Spread a thin layer of sauce over the bottom of a 9×13-inch baking dish.</li>
  <li>Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover.</li>
  <li>Layer with half of the cheese mixture, half of the remaining sauce, and half of the mozzarella cheese.</li>
  <li>Repeat the layers using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella.</li>
  <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
  <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
  <li>Remove the foil and bake until the cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
  <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
</ul>
